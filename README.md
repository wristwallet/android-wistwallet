# android-wistwallet

## Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Android Studio (latest version recommended)
- A Git client to clone the repository
- A physical Android device or emulator for testing
- Java Development Kit (JDK)

## Installing
A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/wristwallet/android-wistwallet.git
```

2. Open the Project in Android Studio

* Open Android Studio.
* Click on 'Open an existing Android Studio project'.
* Navigate to the directory where you cloned the project and select it.
  
3. Install Dependencies

* Android Studio should automatically detect and install any missing dependencies.
* If prompted, sync the project with the Gradle files.
  
4. Set Up an Emulator or Connect a Device

* To set up an emulator, go to AVD Manager in Android Studio, create a virtual device, and start it.  To set up a virtual device that looks like a WristWallet as demonstrated in the video, use the files in the [Android-skin](https://github.com/wristwallet/Android-skin) repo as the custom skin. 
* To use a physical device, connect it to your computer and enable USB debugging in the device's developer options.

5. Run the Application

* In Android Studio, click on the 'Run' button, or press Shift + F10.
* Choose the device or emulator you want to run the app on.

## Built With

* Android Studio - The development environment
* Gradle - Dependency Management
* Java/Kotlin - The primary programming language

## 3D CAD files

* The 3D CAD files can be found in the repo [mechanical-design](https://github.com/wristwallet/mechanical-design). The Solidworks Files can be viewed in the Solidworks CAD software, whereas the STEP files can be uploaded online to a STEP file viewer, for example, https://imagetostl.com/view-stp-online. Do note that the colors of the model won't be shown similar to the video unless viewed with Solidworks software.
